# Write Up & Reflection - *Saanya, Yusra & Faija*

## Overview & Code

The purpose of this project was to create a web app that allowed users in Massachusetts to input a location, and have the app output the closest MBTA station, and whether that MBTA station has wheelchair accessibility. This required us to use two API keys -  MapQuest and MBTA and API keys so that we can scrape information from these websites. The MapQuest API key was utilized first to obtain the current longitude and latitude of the individual, and the latitude and longitude was inputted into the url for the MBTA, to retrieve the data and find the closest station. We then created app.py to input the function into a website. We referenced templates in the template folder in app.py. 

## What Went Well & What Didn't:

Since our Professor provided us with scaffolding, it was a lot easier to us to have some sort of direction in terms of what we needed to return in the equations. What was difficult however, was to collaborate with each other given that we felt as though we could only really collaborate once each person pushed their work to GitHub - whereas we could not all work on a document simultaneously. It was also difficult for us to write the templates because we were not used to html at all, but utilized online resources. 

## What We Would Do Next Time:

Next time, we would probably work on the assignment simultaneously a lot more so that we could think of ideas to go further and provide other tools on this web app. Since we all worked individually and then discussed what we had learned, that wasted time in potentially developing other features of the web app.
